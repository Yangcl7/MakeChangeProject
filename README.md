## Make Change Project 

This project simulates a cash register. A user is asked to enter an item amount. 
The user then enters the amount.

The program will calculate the change returned by largest denomination. For example: 
	
	- User will enter the amount of the item price, in this example case is 32.49.
	
	- User will enter the amount cash tendered.
	
	- If the cash user entered is less than the item price, it will put them in a 
	  loop until the amount is either equal to or greater than the item price.
	
	- If the cash amount is greater than the item price, computer will 
	  calculate the change and give it back by printing the correct amount 
	  in dollars, quarters, dimes and so on
